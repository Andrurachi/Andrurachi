👋 Hi, I’m @Andrurachi, a computer engineering student at Universidad Nacional de Colombia.
👀 I’m interested in coding, tech, and anything related to binary code and technologies.
🌱 I’m currently learning frameworks like React.js and Django for web development, and having fun with WebGL using Three.js. Additionally, I am experimenting with AI using Python.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that utilize code and new technologies to find solutions for modern societal problems and gain experience in the process.
📫 You can find me on Twitter, Telegram, and Discord as @AndruRachi, and on LinkedIn as Andrés R. Chiquillo.
